                Math has always been my biggest passion. What gets me in it is how all of math is 
                somehow derived from logic. Specific field of math that I always enjoyed the most is planimetry - 
                it is not only satisfacting t osolve some problem but also I find it very pleasing 
                to look at a well-drawn solution.

                A lot of aspects of Computer Science are based on mathematical problem-solving
                and thats why from the start of my programming journey I enjoyed algorithmic part of it.
                For me every algorithm is a puzzle that need solving.

                In my free time I love spending time as close to nature as possible and to capture that moments
                often take my camera with me and take photos of everything that surrounds me. Most of theese
                were taken during laying long hours in grass or some bushes.
